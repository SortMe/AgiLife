Description

  AgiLife is a application designed to help you create a schedule based on your priorities in life, which are ever changing and vary in their flexibility. The service will intelligently propose a schedule for the user based on three main categories, including: projects/tasks, health/habits and social/personal happiness. (Note: Perhaps more than just 3) By syncing with services such as Google, Microsoft, MyFitnessPal and Facebook, information can be automatically imported into AgiLife whenever new data is made. AgiLife’s main goal is to make the user’s life easier by encouraging flexibility, adaptiveness and efficiency - in other words, to make their life have agility! Like most calendars, AgiLife will be based off “events”, which take up time slots. Each event will have far more information associated with it than generic calendar events have. 
  
  In AgiLife, each event will have fields such as event type (health, habits, work, school, social life, etc), whether it is a repeating event, what priority does this event take in life, when in general does the user like to accomplish this kind of event, is this event immutable in its’ time slot, etc. Projects will have a cascading system of to-dos which can be synced with other users, and each sub-task/sub-project will have priorities, pre-requirements and time-estimates if the user desires to use them. Using all of this information and more, AgiLife’s intelligent ScheduMe system will create a schedule for the user and request progress updates upon completion of the event. If the user does not finish a task, it will ask the user if they want to re-arrange their schedule in order to fit time for it again Pre-made workout programs could easily be scheduled and started based on the user’s health information, availability, and more. A group scheduling system would be available for users, so that an event creator could send out his or her availability to other users, and they would be able to respond (if they so choose) with their available times. Upon receiving everyone’s replies, the creator could send out one final request for a time, and when it is universally accepted it is added to every user’s calendar. If a user can’t make it, they can see the other available times and propose a re-schedule to all attending users. 



Vision Statement

SortMe Software, the provider of the most intelligent, platform-neutral, and efficient tools to help plan, organize and track the ever-changing lives of it’s customers. 



Motivation

While there are many tools out there for tracking projects, making calendars, organizing schedules or even for tracking progress of health goals and social lives, there aren’t tools for bringing them all together and for making quick schedule changes based off the inevitable changes that pop up.

A perfect user of AgiLife would be a student (like us!). Using it's team scheduling feature and it's priority system, the student can easily schedule his or her time and coordinate times to meet with the rest of their group.  Using integrated features and plans for weight lifting and diet, the student doesn't have to spend time planning those out. A workout schedule with an accompanying diet is made simply by tapping a few buttons! Students are also often on a budget, and AgiLife will take that into account as well. Anyone with a busy, ever-changing lifestyle could benefit from this tool as schedule rearrangement becomes so much easier. 



Risks

We do not have much experience with the platforms we’ll be using, so we’ll need to learn those quickly. In addition, the project has a massive amount of potential, so we risk promising too much. In terms of software needed to implement it, we may have trouble integrating certain services (like Microsoft products or MyFitnessPal). Resources for web development and Android/iOS are fortunately available, and Google’s APIs may be easy to implement as well. 



Risk Mitigation Plan

It’s for these reasons that we’ll be scaling back our initial goal to be a website with accounts, a schedule maker and possibly the group scheduler.. We will have stretch goals for further implementation based off usefulness, uniqueness in the current app world, and difficult of implementation. We should be able to assess relative time investment requirements and use those to facilitate expectations. Initially, our goal will be to create a simple system of schedule-making based off priorities and availabilities.

Software Development Methodology

We will be using Agile methodology for our project to take advantage of Agile’s fluid and flexible capabilities. There are a few reasons we would take this approach to our project. 

First, most of our members will be working with frameworks and languages that we have never worked with, so it is harder to know exactly how much implementation of each feature would take from the beginning. Agile will allow us to set our goals at the beginning of each cycle according to how we are doing.

Second, AgiLife is pretty modular, so it would be possible to assign different features to others and still maintain coordination between different parts through weekly meetings to allow continuous and fast development.

Because we all have different classes, assignments, and tests going on, it is hard to meet up on a daily basis, but we will communicate shortly everyday what kind of progress was made (or none) through slack and take one day to meet for a weekly scrum, where all the parts get together so we can connect finished modules, report progress, diagnose problems in certain parts, set new goals, etc.
